Online banking and mobile apps are available to make managing your money easier. Bank appointments can be scheduled in advance to expedite the process, and some banks, like TD Bank, offer weekend hours for convenience.

Make sure to practice for the interview; typical questions may involve explaining why you chose BU and how you plan to finance your studies. Once approved, your visa will be attached to your passport. Keep your documents organized during travel, as you will need to present them at U.S. customs upon arrival.

On-campus employment may include jobs at university facilities like libraries, dining halls, or academic departments. Off-campus work is not allowed during your first year, but after that, you may be eligible for CPT (Curricular Practical Training) or OPT (Optional Practical Training). CPT is used for internships that are part of your academic program and must be linked to a course. OPT allows you to work in your field of study for up to 12 months after graduation, with an extension for STEM fields up to 24 additional months.

This signature verifies that you are in good standing with your program and have permission to re-enter the U.S. after temporary travel. You need to get your I-20 signed by an International Student Advisor at ISSO before leaving the country. The travel signature is valid for **one year** for current students and **six months** for those on OPT. You should plan ahead and request a travel signature **at least two weeks before your departure** to avoid delays. Bring your I-20 to the ISSO office and fill out a request form. The signed I-20 must be presented at the port of entry upon returning to the U.S. Without a valid travel signature, you may be denied re-entry or experience significant delays.",

Before leaving the U.S., ensure that your I-20 form has a valid travel signature from the ISSO, which is required for re-entry. The travel signature is valid for one year for current students and six months for students on OPT. You should plan ahead and request this signature at least two weeks before your departure. When traveling, carry your passport (valid for at least six months beyond your planned return), F-1 visa, I-20 with a valid travel signature, proof of financial support, and proof of enrollment at BU. If your visa expires while you're outside the U.S., you will need to apply for a new visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate in your home country before re-entry. It is also advisable to carry recent transcripts and proof of your return ticket. Always check current travel restrictions or visa regulations that may impact your re-entry. If you need to travel within the U.S., you do not need a travel signature, but always carry your passport, I-20, and student ID for identification purposes. Ensure you update your address in the SEVIS system within 10 days of moving after any travel or relocation.",

Start the process by ensuring your current visa is nearing its expiration date, as you cannot renew an F-1 visa from within the United States. Here are the key steps for visa renewal: 1) Complete the DS-160 visa application form online, and pay the non-refundable visa application fee. 2) Schedule an appointment at the U.S. embassy or consulate. You will need to bring essential documents, including your valid passport, I-20 with a recent travel signature, SEVIS payment receipt, proof of financial support, and enrollment verification or transcripts from BU. During the visa interview, be prepared to explain your study plan, current program status, and future goals in the U.S. The visa renewal approval time may vary, so it\u2019s advisable to apply well in advance of your planned return to the U.S. Ensure that your passport remains valid for at least six months beyond your expected return date. Remember that you must maintain your student status during the renewal process by being enrolled full-time and complying with F-1 regulations.

It also must be an integral part of your curriculum, often linked to a specific course. CPT is typically used for internships and requires you to have an official job offer before applying. Full-time CPT (over 20 hours per week) is allowed during breaks, while part-time CPT (20 hours or less) can be used during semesters. **OPT**, on the other hand, allows F-1 students to work in their field of study for up to **12 months** after graduation, with a potential extension to **36 months** for STEM graduates. To be eligible for OPT, you must have completed one full academic year in your degree program, and you can apply for OPT up to 90 days before your graduation date or within 60 days after. OPT does not require you to have a job offer at the time of application, giving more flexibility. However, it is important to note that full-time CPT for 12 months or more disqualifies you from applying for OPT. In both cases, ISSO must approve your work authorization, and maintaining a valid F-1 status is required throughout the process.",

      "response": "The OPT (Optional Practical Training) application timeline is critical for F-1 students planning to work in the U.S. after graduation. You can apply for OPT **up to 90 days before your graduation date** and **up to 60 days after graduation**. The entire application process can take **up to 90 days** for USCIS to process, so it is strongly recommended to apply as early as possible. After you receive your OPT I-20 from ISSO, you need to submit your application to USCIS before your 60-day grace period ends after graduation. To apply, you'll need Form G-1145, Form I-765, a copy of your I-20 with an OPT recommendation, your latest I-94, passport copies, visa pages, two recent passport-sized photos, and an application fee of $495. It\u2019s advisable to use **Express or Priority mail** to ensure timely delivery of your application to USCIS. You cannot begin working until you receive your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card and the authorized start date arrives. Always check with ISSO if you need guidance throughout the application process, and keep track of the timelines to avoid delays.",

      "response": "The I-20 form has an expiration date, which represents the anticipated completion date of your academic program at Boston University. It is important to monitor this date carefully to maintain your F-1 status. **If you are unable to complete your program by the date listed on your I-20**, you must request a **program extension** from ISSO at least **30 days before** the current end date. Extensions are only granted under specific circumstances, such as academic reasons or medical conditions, and you will need your advisor's approval. If you complete your program earlier than expected, your I-20 will expire on the actual program completion date. After the I-20 expires, you have a **60-day grace period** to either prepare for departure, apply for OPT, transfer to another school, or change your visa status. Failure to comply with these rules could lead to a loss of legal status in the U.S. Always keep your I-20 updated if there are any significant changes in your program or personal circumstances, and consult with ISSO to ensure compliance with F-1 regulations.",

This grace period allows you to remain in the United States to prepare for departure, apply for OPT, transfer to another academic institution, or change your visa status. During the 60-day grace period, you cannot re-enter the U.S. if you leave the country; this means if you leave during the grace period, you cannot return on your F-1 visa. It is important to use this time to finalize your plans, such as applying for OPT if you intend to work in the U.S., or making arrangements for your next steps. If you plan to transfer to another program or school, this process must be initiated within the grace period to maintain your student status. Failing to act before the grace period ends may result in a loss of legal status, requiring you to leave the U.S. immediately.",

      "response": "As an F-1 student, you must obtain an I-20 travel signature before traveling outside the United States if you plan to return to continue your studies. It is recommended to request a travel signature from the ISSO **at least two weeks before your intended departure**. The travel signature is valid for **one year** for currently enrolled students and **six months** if you are on OPT. If your travel signature is close to expiring, or if you are unsure about its validity, it is best to get a new signature to avoid complications at U.S. ports of entry. The travel signature must be on page two of your I-20, and without a valid signature, you may be denied re-entry to the U.S. You can drop off your I-20 at the ISSO for a travel signature, or consult ISSO to see if there are digital options or mail requests if you are not on campus. Always plan ahead, especially around holidays, when processing times may be longer.",

Some popular options include **Allianz Global Assistance**, **AXA Travel Insurance**, **IMG (International Medical Group)**, and **World Nomads**. It\u2019s important to choose a plan that offers comprehensive medical coverage, including emergency evacuation and repatriation. Make sure that the travel insurance policy meets any visa or country-specific requirements, especially if you plan to travel to different countries. If you already have BU's health insurance (Aetna), check if it offers any travel coverage extensions. Always compare policies for coverage limits, deductibles, and costs before purchasing to find a plan that suits your needs. For additional guidance, the ISSO or Student Health Services can provide more information on recommended providers and policy features.",

Often, departments offer courses labeled as 'Internship,' 'Practicum,' or 'Field Study' that qualify for CPT. You need approval from both your **academic advisor** and **the course instructor** to register for this course, and it must be part of your regular semester schedule. Additionally, you must maintain full-time student status, meaning you are enrolled in enough credits to meet full-time requirements, even while participating in CPT. Keep in mind that CPT cannot be used for part-time jobs that are not related to your studies. You must have a confirmed internship offer before applying for CPT, as the employer details are required in the application. Finally, remember that CPT applications must be processed by the ISSO before you begin work, and this typically requires several weeks, so plan accordingly.",
