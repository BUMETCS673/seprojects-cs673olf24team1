Mechanism for building the CourseBuilder tree for the MSSD program

This code defines the structure for dynamically building a course tree for a 
Master's in Software Systems Development (MSSD) program, providing recommendations 
on course paths based on the student's taken courses, path interests, and electives.

Key Components:
- CourseNode: Represents individual course nodes.
- CourseTree: Builds the course tree based on taken courses and electives.
- read_programs_csv: Reads a CSV file containing program details (core/elective courses, prerequisites).
- read_courses_csv: Reads a CSV file containing detailed course descriptions and prerequisites.
- recommend_courses: Suggests a series of recommended courses for a student.

Functionality:
1. Builds course sequences dynamically based on core course paths (e.g., 521 → 526).
2. Adjusts elective paths based on a student's selected interest and the courses they’ve already taken.
3. Implements prerequisite handling for courses like '767', where '677' must be taken first.
4. Suggests up to a specified number of courses, based on the number of desired courses for the semester.

Details of elective and core course path logic are explained below.
